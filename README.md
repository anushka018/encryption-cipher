Uses a super cipher to encrypt and decrypt strings 

# Background cipher information
1. Caesar cipher (also known as a shift cipher)
shifts the characters in a string by a given value to a new characters in the English aplhabet

2. Even odd cipher (bifid cipher)
divides string in half and moves all even indexed characters to the front and all odd indexed characters to the end

3. Word replacement cipher (substitution cipher)
changes any occurances of a given string to the corresponding replacement

A super cipher combines all 3 of these ciphers for encryption and decryption of messages
This cipher is more difficult to break, whereas any of these three ciphers used alone would be fairly simple to crack
